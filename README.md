In this scenario, I am a new data engineer at the fictional company Pewlett Hackard (PH). I am tasked with conducting research on all of the employees of PH between the 1980s and 1990s. All of the available and relevant information are contained within six CSV files within the folder labelled "data".

There were 3 main objectives to complete, model the data, engineer the data and analyse the data
1. Modelling was completed by forming an Entity Relationship Diagram. The website www.quickdatabasediagrams.com was used.
2. Engineering was completed by creating table schema for all of the CSV files. The software pgAdmin 4 was used.
3. Analysis was done by creating tables that showed various specific information about employees.
